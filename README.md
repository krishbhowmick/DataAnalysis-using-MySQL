#SQL


Knowledge of SQL and relational databases is also very useful for an improved understanding of data flow in information systems, as it makes it easier to create reports and apply them to your needs.It allows you to better understand and interpret documents that contain results from databases, and it enables you to conduct a deeper analysis of the data stored in relational databases. Thatâ€™s why SQL for business analyst positions is becoming an industry standard rather than a nice-to-have skill. 

In above we have done few retrieve query using dummy data with the help of MySQL. Have a look at it.
